Symfony serializer integration
===

The denormalization process also instantiates your model. This means that it needs some customization.

The Domain Component comes with a layer that gives you the ability to add the feature in the Symfony Serializer. If you use the bundle, this is automatically configured.

Please note that this is also compatible with [ApiPlatform](https://github.com/api-platform/api-platform)..
